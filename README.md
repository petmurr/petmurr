&ensp; Play around with this inverted reaction wheel pendulum, created with <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear Imgui</a>, compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten. This simulation is unrealistic but very fun to play with.

&ensp; Taking inspiration from 3B1B's <i>Manim</i>- more specifically, <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim Community</a>- I created a series of videos that go over the basics of the rapidly exploring random tree, an interesting and fundamental motion planning concept that lacked any beautiful visual representation.
